ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeffrey-kirumba.

- I am a Computer Science major and a Finance minor at the University of Houston. 
- I have been programming seriously since Spring 2019. It has been an exciting and humbling journey. 
- In the beginning, I was introduced to programming in an elective class for Computer Engineering majors. This class taught me the basic syntax of C++.
- Soon after, I learned object oriented programming with Python in UH's intro class, COSC 1306. 
- From there, I learned data structures in Java and then eventually took an Algorithms course (in the language of my choice, I chose Python). 


Side Projects: 

- Initially, most of my side projects consisted of following web development tutorials (mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
- This led me to learn the backend frameworks Django and Flask. Also, JavaScript's runtime environment node.js.
- After taking UH's Algorithms and Databases courses, I got into visualizing and analysing data. 
- I learned and utilized python libraries Beautiful Soup, numpy, pandas, streamlit, and yfinance. 

Whats Next?:
- I have been experimenting with pytorch and would like to explore developing machine learning models.
- I see a lot of cool React.js and React Native projects here on Github and on YouTube I will deploy my own very soon!
